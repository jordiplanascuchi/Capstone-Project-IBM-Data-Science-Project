    "* Is there a relationship between the socioeconomic status of people living in a district and the profile of venues in it?\n",
    "The target audience are:\n",
    "* Companies wishing to stablish in Girona or new businesses that want to open in Girona\n",
    "* Local city council\n",

    "## 1.2 Background\n",
    "Cities, as large human settlements, flourished in parallel with the development of agriculture and have been characterized by the specialization and social division of labor. Great cities have existed in all civilizations of the human history and they have been planned and managed by bureaucracy systems which needed data science to do the job. One example that I like to use to link cities and data science is the development of the concept of the number zero. Even if in some of them the number was not invented, most of the ancient civilizations developed the concept of zero and used it for calculations in many areas like accounting, astronomy, geography etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cities are great places to enhance human interaction both for the good and for the bad. In both cases data science is paramount in improving human life. In this project I develop a process to gather data from cities which can be used by different stakeholders. I’m mainly targeting\n",
    "* Companies which want to explore the socioeconomic landscape of cities to make informed decisions about their businesses\n",
    "* Government and governmental agencies seeking to improve resource allocation, from the deployment of police forces to budget allocation\n",
    "In all these cases, a fine granulation of the city would be of major interest as it allows us to make a zoom to small patches that can be also aggregated conveniently. Often, postal code areas are used to do this division of the city, but I think that census areas are a better choice. Census areas in Catalonia are areas where there are between 500 and 2000 electors. One census area cannot include territories of more than one municipality, and they can be grouped administratively into census districts. Moreover, official statistical data is geographically segmented by census districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use Girona as a case study that can be later extrapolated to other cities in the country. Girona will be divided in census areas and from this reference area, Foursquare will be used to locate venues in neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Mapping venues\n",
    "Mapping venues in towns is the first step in the process of typifying census areas with relation to the profile of facilities and commercial activities. This profiling can be complemented and/or further correlated with other statistical data like socioeconomic status of inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an area is characterized by the presence of restaurants and small households occupied mainly by young people, a real state company can focus its efforts in selling or hiring in this area to this profile of young single or couple wealthy people. If there is another area with parks and supermarkets and households are of an average four people, this means that it may be a family neighborhood. A supermarket chain may consider it as a target neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "For governmental stakeholders, checking the reviews of businesses around an area might be a very useful source of information to plan specific support actions for this or that particular area.\n"

    "The data can be downloaded directly from the Jupiter notebook, or can be downloaded externally and kept in a local file to be further imported in the notebook. I chose the second system to avoid that network problems interfere with the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure beside, there is a schematic representation of the transformations that have been performed in the Geografic data from ICC and GOD. In the original sources, geographical data is kept in Shapefile format which is a common format used in geographical information systems (GIS). However, the geojson format is increasingly used in data science and is the format that is used to feed map tools like Folium and Choropleth. Thus, the first step will be to transform .shp files into .json files thanks to a library PyShp. I will define the function *shpToGeoJSON* were I will use the [PyShp](https://pypi.org/project/pyshp/) tools to read .shp files and return the information in the form of python dictionaries.\n",
    "In both ICC and GOD the geographical data is kept in utm coordinates, but many current applications are better fed with WGS84 coordinates. So, I will transform the utm coordinates to WGS84 coordinates with the help of a library [PyProj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproject/). For this job I’ll create the function *getWGS84Coordinates*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is in json format and the coordinates are coded with the WGS84 system, I’ll make some small transformations like changing some town codes by the official name of the town, this is for the sake of readability of data when observing them. I’ll also create a merged code joining the district code and the section code to uniquely identify each census section in Girona."

    "Foursquare is a powerful database that can be easily accessed with APIs provided in its developer page. However, there are some limitations that forces us to do some extra work. The main limitation I found is that the results of searches for venues are given in circle area defined by a radius. I want to assign each venue to the census section to where it belongs to. In order to achieve that I will make the following steps:\n",
    " 1.\tDetermine the centroid of each census are which are, for the most, quite irregular polygons. For this I use the library *scipy.spatial* which has a tool to calculate the convex hull of a polygon. Then the centroid of the convex hull is the mean of the x coordinates and the mean of the y coordinates of the hull. I used this approximation because it gives better results than the simpler approximation of determining the centroid as the means of the points of the raw polygon (data not shown).\n",
    " 2.\tOnce the centroid is found I use the function *distanceBetweenPoints* to determine the longest distance between the centroid and all the vertices. This will be the distance used to assign the parameter RADIUS in the Foursquare search.\n",
    " 3.\tNext step is to retrieve Foursquare data using latitude and longitude of the centroid of each census section and the radius as the longest distance between centroid and vertices. But this will yield a lot of overlapping information as the circle defined by the radius in each census section will intersect with the circles of the neighboring sections. \n",
    " 4.\tOnce venue data are obtained, venues that do not belong to the census section must be filtered out. In order to do this, I’ll have to check if venue coordinates are inside the polygon which defines the census section. This can be easily done using the function *polygon.contains* of the [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) library that I’ll execute inside the local function *ifInDistrict*.\n",

    "The total amount of venues recorded in the Foursquare database from Girona is less than 300, a number which is far below the actual number of venues. Girona is a very dynamic town and the commercial center of a rather big geographical area. It accumulates many governmental offices and it hosts a university which has had a great impact on the city over the last 30 years. However underrepresented, the Foursquare venues are able to capture the special profile of the different neighborhoods. There is a great cluster containing four neighborhoods, Centre, Eixample, Santa Eugènia and Oest. They are the four neighborhoods that constitute what we can call the center of the city. Although the socioeconomic profile of these four neighborhoods is not necessarily similar in the streets there is a complex mixture of restaurants, supermarkets, groceries, hairdressers etc. All four neighborhoods are places with all you need to live and, at the same time, in most of them there are locations were people from other neighborhoods may eventually go shopping.\n",
    "Next cluster is formed by the neighborhoods Est and Sud. They are very different neighborhoods in term of socioeconomic landscape. While Est is a low-income neighborhood, Sud has areas with people with very high income. However, the venues profile is similar and it is basically characterized by almost no retailers nor personal services, and the presence of some municipal equipment.\n",
    "Finally, we have three clusters with only one neighborhood. Montjuïc is a residential area with some gardens. Nord is a mixture of working-class immigration and working-class native population which is located a bit far away from the city center. It is by no means a commercial place, but there you can find some specialized businesses. The las one, Mas Xirgu, is a very special one, we see it coming alone in every clustering because it is basically an industrial area with special business like car dealers, garages, pet shops and clinics, and industrial providers.\n",
    "### Neighborhoods by education level\n",
    "When looking at Girona by its venues profile the main feature was the presence of a great center comprising four neighborhoods. When we look at the education level, the city is split into three clear areas and the center is also split. Now, Montjuïc joins the Centre, Eixample and Sud neighborhoods. These are the places where people with the highest education is living. Next, with middle education levels we find the west crown of the city, Santa Eugènia, Oest and Nord. Finally, neighborhoods Est and Mas Xirgu cluster together even if their profile is not exactly the same. Both have a lot of people without primary studies or just with primary studies. This is probably what makes them clustering together. But Mas Xirgu has half of people under 16 as compared with Est and Mas Xirgu. Instead Mas Xirgu has almost 16% of people with university studies while in Est neighborhood it is a bare 3%.\n",
    "### Neighborhoods by number of people in households\n",
    "Clustering by the number of people in households is often a good way to reveal socioeconomic features of neighborhoods and a good way to reveal familiar structures if any. Clustering Girona according to number of people in households yields a rather atomized map, with three clusters with two neighborhoods in it and three neighborhoods that come alone. First of all, the neighborhood Centre is a very special one, one of those which has experienced a process of gentrification due to the pressure of tourism and university students. Here 65% of houses have one or two residents, while only 7% of the houses have more than 4 residents. Montjuïc is another singularity, it has the lowest proportion of houses with a single resident and 75% of houses have between 2 and 4 residents, it is the prototypical middle-class family neighborhood. Mas Xirgu comes again as a special case, it has the highest number of houses with only one resident and together with houses with two residents make up 75% of households. Then there is a 22% of households with four or five residents, showing the presence of two very different areas in the same neighborhood.\n",
    "Neighborhoods Est and Santa Eugènia probably cluster together because they are the two neighborhoods with the highest proportion of houses with 5 residents or more with more than 16% of households.\n",
    "Neighborhoods Sud and Oest are family neighborhoods with more than 90% of households with 1 to four residents, the class with two residents per house being the one with more occurrences.\n",
    "In neighborhoods Nord and Eixample the leading categories are the hoses with one or two residents and then, at a certain distance, families with 3 or 4 members.\n",
    "In summary, the profile of Girona is that of a modern city were families are getting smaller and most people live alone or just in a couple. However, slight differences are relevant and show that the map of the city is quite diverse."

    "*\tFoursquare might not be the most comprehensive database to make a venues profile of the city of Girona. In the future this should be complemented with data from other databases like google maps.\n",
    "*\tGirona is a small town of 102 thousand people but it is a quite diverse city we can say that neighborhoods matter, they matter in terms of venues and in terms of socioeconomic profile. Clustering them by different criteria gives different results showing that having the right information might be crucial for city management.\n",
